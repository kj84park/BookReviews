### I've studied Oauth 2.0 many times.

### As far as I remember,

### When I was a new employee, when I prepared the IDP project early last year, etc.

### I've developed biometric authentication stuff, authentication apps for ios, android as well.

### Because I usually deal with the client-side, I've never deep-dived this tech.

### So there are unclear parts about Oauth2.0 for me.

### Anyway, This book has good content regarding Oauth 2.0.

### Unfortunately, A lot of typos have been found.

### It is quite deep in content, 

### And it was very helpful for understanding because it informed a lot of implementation intentions.

### So I'm very pleased to meet this book. 

### It may give me a lot of improvement in my job.

### 3.5/5
